# Isomorphic strings in C

This program was made to check if two given strings are isomorphic.
To see it in action simply run the executable "RunTests". If you want to make any changes and recompile it
make sure to first download the gcc compiler in this [page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/).
Once you have the compiler run the command "gcc isostrings.c isotests.c -o RunTests" in order
to see your new changes in action.
